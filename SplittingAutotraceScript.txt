Run Program
_______________________________________________
AutoSmarTrace(InputFilePath,OutputName,pixelSize,OptionalInput);


InputFilePath: string containing the path to the directory containing the images

OutputName: string containing the name for the folder created with figures of traces and name for the output data structure containing chain data.

pixelSize: size of the pixels in the image (default nanometres).

OptionalInput: optional string input; currently if this is 'EM', optimizes chain tracing for EM images, and if this is 'actin', optimizes tracing for actin filaments. Also, if it is having trouble tracing, this could be 'filter', and additional filters may be applied to improve tracing in some cases.

ex: |AutoSmarTrace('C:\Project\Image Data','Data Set 1',0.5);
ex: |AutoSmarTrace('C:\Project\Image Data','Data Set 2',3.94,'actin');

*For vscode, have the matlab terminal ready, drop down arrow beside powershell*

Parameters:
———————————————————
input_path: Path to images 
out_filename: Saving folder name
nmperpix: Size of 1 pixel (using 2.0 by default)
varargin: Optional parameter, custom skip amount for chain points (Em)

Neural Net: NetworkGen2.mat

Custom Functions
———————————————————————————————
load_data: Loads image data and processes it (greyscale, crop, normalization) and extracts filename and resolution data 

PointProcess: Extract the chains from the images

angdiff: Computes difference between two angles and ensure its between -pi and pi

getpoints: Extracts and process points from the chain, fits B-spline to them and perform further image based adjustments and tracing calcs. 

combo_calc: Compute tangent correlations, end to end distances along traced chain. Compile measures such as spline increments, curvature, angular changes.

savedata: Save processed tracing data and associated parameters into a MAT file for later analysis.

saveimage: Saves current figurine Matlab figure format and PNG.

point_at_length: Retrieve a point and its derivative on the chain corresponding to the specified arc length.

Parameters:
———————————————————
input_path: Path to images 
out_filename: Saving folder name
nmperpix: Size of 1 pixel (using 2.0 by default)
varargin: Optional parameter, custom skip amount for chain points (Em)

Neural Net: NetworkGen2.mat

Custom Functions
———————————————————————————————
load_data: Loads image data and processes it (greyscale, crop, normalization) and extracts filename and resolution data 

PointProcess: Extract the chains from the images

angdiff: Computes difference between two angles and ensure its between -pi and pi

getpoints: Extracts and process points from the chain, fits B-spline to them and perform further image based adjustments and tracing calcs. 

combo_calc: Compute tangent correlations, end to end distances along traced chain. Compile measures such as spline increments, curvature, angular changes.

savedata: Save processed tracing data and associated parameters into a MAT file for later analysis.

saveimage: Saves current figurine Matlab figure format and PNG.

point_at_length: Retrieve a point and its derivative on the chain corresponding to the specified arc length.
